So here is a neat visual effect where it makes the character's super ability make him look on fire through a shader effect and some particles. When the character activates his ability, through VFX he generates a mound of fire and creates a huge flaming sledgehammer. 

I like it a lot because it makes the player feel powerful right when they activate their super ability.

The shader on the player model does not seem to change on the camera view but the particles do.

The effect generates an emmisive kind of effect to give the illusion that is on fire. It looks like it updates the geometry and with a noise texture and it has the texture changing through some fire gradient.

I think it is similar to a dissolve texture but is always running, because of the way it is changing color throughout the geometry.
